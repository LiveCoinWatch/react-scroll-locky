# ðŸ“œðŸ”’ react-scroll-locky 
----
ðŸ“œ Prevents page from being scrolled. Or any other "not permitted" container.

ðŸ’¡ Hides scrollbars, preserving page width.

ðŸ¤˜ Works on any desktop or __mobile__ browser.

ðŸ“¦ All features are hidden inside.

ðŸ‘« Stands more that one instance.

ðŸ¤” Supports nested locks

ðŸ”¥ Supports nested scrollable elements.

### Just wrap your content with `<ScrollLocky />` and it block any iterations with the rest of a page. 

This is one line solution for the problem.

All due to [React-Locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-locky) it uses underneath

__this could be dangerous__ for focus state management.
Consider use more _composite_ library - [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) - to handle the every edge case.
- focus
- scroll
- aria (inert)  

# API

Just wrap _anything_ with `ScrollLocky`, which accepts only one prop - "enabled"

There is only a few pros to configure
 -  `noRelative` - do not apply "position:relative" on body.
 -  `noImportant` - do not apply "!important" to any rules.
 -  `className` - className for a internal div
 -  `headless` - enables "no-div" mode (will pick the first DOM node-inside)
 -  `enabled` - allows to disable Lock behavior (CSS modification and Locky), keeping it rendered.
 -  `isolation` - allows to disable event isolation, preventing only `scroll` events, not everything outside target node (default behaviour).
 Use `isolation:false` if you have some "shadow" underneath modal, to catch and redirect all events. 
 -  `gapMode=[padding|margin(default)]` - gap policy, to control the way scrollLocky generate `the gap` instead of scrollbars.
This option affects how absolutely positioned elements will work:
    - gapMode="padding" - "right:0" will be on window right (will jump on scroll removal)
    - gapMode="margin" - "right:0" will be in constant position (will not jump, but leave a gap)

```js
import {ScrollLocky} from 'react-scroll-locky';

<Modal>
 <ScrollLocky>
   <MyContent>
     Anything!
   </MyContent>
 </ScrollLocky>
</Modal>   
```

## Hide scrollbars only
To hide body scrollbars only (does not disable scroll on scrollable container, or body scroll on iOS) use `HideBodyScroll` component
```js
import {HideBodyScroll} from 'react-scroll-locky';

<HideBodyScroll noRelative noImportant gapMode/> // body scrollbar is hidden
```

# The order
You may have more than one _active_ Lock on the page:
 - Only first Lock is `real`. Only it hides the scrollbars.
 - Only the last Lock is `active`. Only last-mounted Locky is working, silencing the rest of a page.
 - To have more that one active lock - consider using `HideBodyScroll` + `react-locky` directly.

# Gap modes
 - "padding" - for the simple use. It will keep scroll-bar-gap for the normal elements,
 letting _absolutely_ or _fixed_ positioned elements hit the right-most window edge.
 - "margin" - for the advanced use. Will always preserve the gap, letting only the 
 `fixed` positioned elements fill the while page(preffered mode)  
 
Default Gap Mode is "margin", it would fit for _almost_ anyone.
But if you have another margin on your body (please dont), or have `width:100%` on the body - it would not.

Then, and only then use `gapMode="padding"`, and dont forget to add `box-sizing: border-box;` to include _paddings_, we are going to set, to your width.
(and don't send paddings on body, then).
 
 To _fill_ the gap with `absolute` positioned elements - use another exposed component.

Special component - `ScrollLockyPane` will help maintain the right "right" position.
Alternatively - use `react-scroll-locky-edge-right` class, to set proper right border for a container.
```js
import {ScrollLocky, ScrollLockyPane} from 'react-scroll-locky';

// position:absolute, left:0, right: -"gap"px
<ScrollLockyPane>
  // your modal inside
  <Modal>
     <ScrollLocky>
        <MyContent/>  
     </ScrollLocky>
  </Modal> 
</ScrollLockyPane>
```


`ScrollLockyPane` will "return" the "consumed" width to the component.

# Multiple locks
- If you need multiple locks to be active in a same time - just do it. They will work together.

## More

For a good modals you also need a proper Focus Management Library.
Use [react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock) to complete the picture.
