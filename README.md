# API

Just wrap _anything_ with `ScrollLocky`, which accepts only one prop - "enabled"

There is only two pros to configure
 -  `noRelative` - do not app "position:relative" on body.
 -  `gapMode=[padding|margin]` - gap policy, you may choose how to generate the gap,
 it is affects how absolutely positioned elements will work
    - gapMode="padding" - "right:0" will be on window right (will jump on scroll removal)
    - gapMode="margin" - "right:0" will be in constant position (will not jump, but leave a gap)

```js
import {ScrollLocky} from 'react-scroll-locky';

<Modal>
 <ScrollLocky>
   <MyContent>
     Anything!
   </MyContent>
 </ScrollLocky>
</Modal>   
```
